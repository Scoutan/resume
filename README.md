<h1>My Resume</h1>
This is the online version of my resume, which serves as my hands-on practice of Next.js and Material-UI.
<hr />
<h2>-Design-</h2>
The colors of the UI is inspired by "award-winning" web designs. The rest is essentially from my own creativity as I go through the library of Material-UI, for example, the interactivity of "timeline" API seemed fun so I began to think about how I can implement it into the theme of "resume".

<br />
Overall, I want to explore user experience, with 3 emphases:
<ol>
  <li>responsiveness from desktop to mobile,</li>
  <li>ease of navigation, and</li>
  <li>intuitive placements of information.</li>
</ol>
