<h2>My Resume</h2>
This is the online version of my resume, which serves as my hands-on practice of Next.js and Material-UI.
<hr />
<h3>-Design-</h3>
The colors of the UI is inspired by "award-winning" web designs. The rest is essentially from my own creativity as I go through the library of Material-UI, for example, the interactivity of "timeline" API seemed fun so I began to think about how I can implement it into the theme of "resume". Overall, I want to explore user experience, with 3 emphases: (1) responsiveness from desktop to mobile, (2) ease of navigation, and (3) intuitive placements of information.
